Editor & Tech Support: sqooid.\n\nOriginal: [Qidian](https://www.qidian.com/book/1262627/).\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThey were not cast into these troubled waters by accident; it was their own choice.\n\nSome wanted to become kings and hegemons; some wanted to save the world from destruction; and some wanted to stop the last barbaric conquest of civilization, and thus rewrite the history of the Chinese people.\n\nOf course, some people just wanted to gather a harem and live a life they couldn’t in the modern world.\n\nIt is this group of ordinary people, each with their own goals and motivation, who have neither the courage of lions nor the invincibility of fairy-tale heroes, that set forth on a new journey. They crowd onto an old ship, armed with modern technology and knowledge, and cast off into the sunset years of the Ming Dynasty.\n\nDestination: Hainan.\n\n![lingao cover](/lgqm/images/uploads/cover.png)",
