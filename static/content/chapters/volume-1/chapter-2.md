Wen Desi then briefly narrated his experiences when he went through the portal by himself. The other end of it lay at the base of a non-descript hill, right on the side of a river. Judging from the development of the surrounding land it appeared to be a rather prosperous agricultural region. The geography and vegetation placed him in the southern reaches of China. Just as he was contemplating whether or not he wanted to take a risk and venture further to try to scout out a village, something unexpected happened. 

A group of soldiers in old-fashioned armour had escorted a dozen or so villagers to the riverside, under the command of a mounted officer. Swiftly several heads went flying, and with a clatter, only a few broken weapons were left next to the corpses. The soldiers gathered around their officer and soon left.

Although Wen Desi had seen some fairly gory stuff online before, being a spectator in reality still brought an incomparable shock to him. 

“...Luckily I was wearing camo, otherwise I’d have been done for.” Wen Desi said. He still felt a lingering fear. “The closest one of them was less than ten metres away.”

The first impressions that Wen Desi had of this new world was that one, the air was fresh, and two, that life there was bleak.

Wen Desi opened his notebook, and showed the others the pictures he’d taken of the scene. With the clarity of a 9 Megapixel camera, the headless and bloody corpses were cast in a nauseating light.

“I also found some copper coins scattered nearby.” Wen Desi brought out a plastic bag. Inside were a dozen copper coins. “Several of them in fact. I asked someone to look into them, and the latest date from Tianqi’s reign[^18].”

“It could also be Chong Zhen’s time.”

“Well, at least two years into Tianqi.” Xiao Zishan said confidently. “Tai Chang was only emperor for a few months before he passed, and so in the first year of Tianqi the coins minted were still those of his fathers. Only from the second year onwards were the coins relabeled to those of Tianqi. If we take into account the time it would take to mint as well as circulate around, a good guess would probably put us somewhere after the third year of Tianqi.[^19]”

“But the time frame is still pretty wide. The two brothers Tianqi and Chongzhen ruled for over twenty years combined.”

“I think it should be during Tianqi, or at least the start of Chongzhen. Chongzhen’s coin was minted in great quantities and circulated widely, it'd be impossible to find Tian Qi’s money during his reign.” 

“Well with the time period established, what are our actual plans?”

A wormhole into an alternate space-time would be a milestone for modern science. But the three people inside the toilet were not physicists, and would indubitably have no share of the Nobel prize. If they wanted to make it big in the news… well, none of them were in the media circles either. They would only be relegated to the sidelines. Of course, as the discoverer, Desi would probably be mentioned a little. 

Regardless, they all knew of the massive conspiracy that would inevitably cover up the existence of this wormhole, like the Americans and Area 51\. If this were to occur then their future prospects didn’t look too good. At least, if Wen Desi wanted to win a physics prize or some such there was no way he would have made that bulletin post. 

All three of them knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Just how big of one? Just as Desi had said, large enough to contain a whole other world from the 17th century. Thinking of this, their breathing became excited. 

After a brief discussion echoed in the bathroom of Wen Desi’s house, the Executive Committee was formed. Soon followed Document No. 1\. In the histories of the new world, this meeting would be later known as the “Bathroom Conference.”

The resolution adopted by the conference? To build a new world\!

But how would they go about this? The people of the 17th century were not NPCs.[^20] They would not lose to modern humanity on intelligence, courage or strength. They even had a home-ground advantage. Although the three of them enjoyed reading time travel novels, doing it for real would be very different.

The only aspect that the time-travellers were superior in compared to the locals was the 300 years of civilisation and development between them.

“Scale and standardisation.” Wang Luobin said. “This will be our path to victory. An industrialised society will always defeat an agrarian one.” 

They would need to gather up a large group of people knowledgeable in modern-day science and management techniques, as well as modern machinery and technology. By bringing all this across the wormhole, they could establish a rudimentary industrial base and from there conquer the whole world[^21]. 

A journey of a thousand steps always starts with the first. Regardless of how far-flung this goal seemed, they could only take it one step at a time. The small group arrived at two short-term goals after a brief discussion: one, to gather a group of fellow time travellers, and two, to raise funds to buy supplies and equipment. 

Wen Desi first decided to create a Skype group chat[^22] to use for communication. The original bulletin post had already become extremely popular, but there wasn’t much detail in the post itself. He now appended to the post a link to the Skype group and a spare email address for contact. Then he simply locked the post. All three of them agreed that starting from now it wouldn’t be a good idea to draw too much attention to themselves.

On the topic of money, although the three of them had some money, pooling everything together only got them to just shy of a million yuan[^23]. To rebuild an industrial society from scratch with just a million yuan would be way too sci-fi. 

In theory, the people who joined later would also bring some funds in, but probably not enough to dramatically transform their financial situation. Perhaps the only realistic way of making money would be by trading goods through the wormhole, taking advantage of the price differential on the two sides.

To make huge profits using modern day goods in an ancient era must be the most tried and tested method in all time travel fiction. Everyone thought of the standard culprits: glass lenses, glass cups, matches, watches, and so on. Countless time travellers had used these methods to become rich. After making their first pot of gold they would then be able to embark for real on their path to the top.

Xiao Zishan decided to contribute the promotional goods accumulated from his company to the cause: the makeup boxers with an in-built mirror, the melamine bowls and cutlery, the little fruit knives, the synthetic kitchen aprons, the acrylic hats, gloves and scarves, the glass mugs, the plastic plates, towels…all in all, about 3 or 4 boxes filled with these assorted knick-knacks. These trinkets, made in Yiwu county[^24], printed all over with ugly company branding, now appeared to be shining piles of gold money in the eyes of the three.

Although Venetian glass lenses were a luxury good in 17th century Europe[^25], they didn’t even exist in Asia. From this they could build a monopoly in glass alone. This is not even to mention those unshatterable plastic plates and bowls, transparent lunch boxes[^26], even the plastic water bottles that they had just emptied. Any of these things would be novel to that time period. Logically speaking, they could set the price to be anything they wanted: a hundred taels[^27] for a powder box, two thousand taels for a cup, a hundred taels for a bowl…how many time travellers had done the same thing?

The three of them all felt their blood pressure rise in anticipation of their golden-bright future. Wen Desi even started having some regrets. Perhaps keeping the wormhole to himself could still let him control all of the other world. 

“But if we go over like this, we’d be arrested immediately at the city gates and sent to the Coast guard office[^28].” Wang Luobin brought up a practical question.

“Is there such an office in Guangzhou?” 

“Not sure, but there is a Maritime Customs there[^29].” 

“Good point though, we are wearing strange clothes and speak in a strange accent. Guangzhou is not a sparsely populated place. And we also don’t have maps of the local roads…[^30]”

“We wouldn’t end up banished to Liaodong right…[^31]”

“Probably not, but if we were to be brought to court because of our strange get-ups, if we were not to be straight-up executed we would at least lose a layer of skin.” Xiao Zishan remembered the memoirs of several Portuguese travellers to Ming China. One of the Portuguese pirates recorded his entire experience after being taken as a prisoner of war. Although he expressed great admiration for the justice system of the Ming dynasty, praising its fairness, impartiality and openness, he also didn’t hesitate to describe the cruel punishment of the criminals.

Thinking of the cruel experiences seen by that Portuguese man, Xiao Zishan couldn’t help but shiver a little in fear.

“Why don’t we find some websites that sell hanfu[^32]? I've seen some that are very meticulous with their Ming-era clothing.”

“We can do the clothes, but we can’t learn the way people speak and act.” Wang Luobin rebutted. “That'll draw much more attention.”

“Why don’t we pretend to be foreign merchants? From Borneo or something.” Wen Desi suggested. “Could we even pretend to be envoys from a foreign country? All the emperors love having foreigners present tributes.”

Xiao Zishan thought for a while. “But I remember that the Ming dynasty was very strict about people from overseas. Apart from the Portuguese, all foreign merchants could only trade in Macau. Their ships could not even enter the mouth of the Pearl river.”

“Wait, the Portuguese could enter Guangzhou?”

“Yeah, every year in Guangzhou city there would be a trade fair and merchants from all over the country would head there to trade with the Portuguese.”

“I didn’t know the Guangzhou trade fair had such a long history\![^33]” Wang Desi exclaimed.

“Hmm, there’s still a problem. None of us look Portugese. Back then, were there any overseas Chinese people?”

“Maybe? Who knows.”

“Damn this is giving me a headache. We need to do some research.”

Suddenly, Xiao Zishan slapped the table and smiled. “We’re so dumb\! Why are we thinking of entering Guangzhou city when we’re currently in it already?”

Everyone brightened up. Indeed, since the two ends of the wormhole were in the same spot, as long as the other end were positioned inside the city walls of that era then wouldn’t they end up in the city directly? If anything got too dangerous then they could simply open the wormhole again and run away.

The final location they settled on was Haopan street, which was originally in the southern part of Guangzhou along the Pearl river. The area had been a busy commercial district ever since the latter part of the Song dynasty, and had only become more prosperous in the Ming. In the years of Jiajing[^34] Guangzhou city was expanded to include this riverside commercial district. Since then, the south walls of the city had been standing on the banks of the Pearl.

Haopan street in the Ming dynasty was a residential area for merchants from other states, and was also a hotspot for smugglers. This group of people would collude with the fishermen of Youyuzhou near the mouth of the Pearl River[^35], specialising in smuggling foreign goods. “Every time a sailship arrived, all the merchants of Haopan street would load up porcelain, silk, money, gunpowder onboard. The boats would also leave full and return full.” Xiao Zishan was sceptical about these interstate merchants. They must’ve had some backing in officialdom, otherwise how could the smuggling be so rampant?

At least, as long as everyone was in the smuggling business, they would definitely not care about where these new strangers came from. Profit was the basic instinct of all merchants. From this point of view, the business people of Haopan street were the most suitable for first contact.

[^18]:  The actual name of the coin, sort of like pounds, shillings etc., is ‘Tong Bao’

[^19]:  A little clunky because years would be measured from the start of an imperial reign, sort of like what Japan does still with the current Reiwa period. The name of the period is distinct from the actual name of the emperor. 

[^20]:  A term from video games, meaning Non-player characters (NPC). 

[^21]:  Seems a bit evil in English, but OK then.

[^22]:  Well, this really shows the age of this novel doesn’t it? 

[^23]:  About $140,000 USD. 

[^24]:  County in Zhejiang province. Famous for its light industry (i.e. making trinkets like the ones Zishan listed). 

[^25]:  Venice had become a very large manufacturing centre for luxury glass goods in the late 13th century, especially because of the high quality glass mix produced at Murano, a part of the islands. Popularity of Venetian glass peaked in the 15th and 16th century, and in fact by the 17th century this industry was actually on its decline in Venice due to rising competition from continental glass makers.

[^26]:  Presumably ones made from clear acrylic or glass.

[^27]:  A tael (liang) is a chinese unit of weight, equal to about 50 grams metric or one sixteenth of a catty (Jin). Note however that the precise definitions in ancient China varied geographically and over time. The weight is most often used as a unit of mass of silver used as a currency.

[^28]:  A government office in ancient China responsible for keeping the coastlines safe from foreigners.  

[^29]:  An ancient Chinese customs office. [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B8%82%E8%88%B6%E5%8F%B8](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B8%82%E8%88%B6%E5%8F%B8)

[^30]:  “勘合路引”, meaning some sort of permit needed to travel on the roads? I imagine something similar to serfs in the feudal west, who had to get written permits from their local nobility to travel anywhere. They would usually be limited to a specific destination and time frame. Similar permits would be issued for other people such as skilled craftsmen or even merchants. I’m not familiar enough with Chinese feudal society to say exactly where the overlaps end, or even how these Chinese permits would work in practice. 

[^31]:  A peninsula in the high north-east of China, next to the border with modern-day North korea. Outside the Great Wall.

[^32]:  Hanfu is a traditional style of dress, lit. dress of the Han people.

[^33]:  See Canton Fair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton\_Fair)

[^34]:  1521-1567 AD

[^35]:  Youyuzhou, I can’t find where this actually is. Presumably somewhere close to the estuary, but English search isn’t giving any useful results. From what I can tell it was a name that the locals used for a region along the river where most of the merchant fleets would offload their cargo (outside of Guangzhou), but the name didn’t stick around into the modern day. If someone knows where this is let me know\!
