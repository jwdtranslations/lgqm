After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Gao Ju, Xiao Zishan bade farewell and returned to the base. Shopkeeper Sun from the Qiwei Escort Agency had already been waiting there for a long while. Before Xiao Zishan could bow to thank him, Sun Kecheng bowed first. Xiao Zishan passed over a hundred taels of silver as a thank you gift.

“You are all very talented\!” Shopkeeper Sun accepted the silver and smiled like a flower, “Such great gongfu and such fierce firearms\! My apprentices and disciples all said that they had seen many rescue operations, but never such a clean and quick one.”

“Not at all, not at all. If it weren’t for the help of Qiwei, us outsiders would probably still be groping in the dark even now.”

“No, no, Qiwei is just doing their little part.” Owner Sun handed the bag of silver to the young follower behind him, “I have something to say. May Shopkeeper Xiao take heed.”

“Please.”

“Although the rescue this time was successful, the bandits have attacked here and have become familiar with the area. We must be on guard for their retaliation. As the saying goes: a thief steals only once, but you can’t be on guard against them forever. You have a lot of wealth here, so you must be careful.”

Xiao Zishan was a little confused about what he meant. He had just been fooled by that old fox Master Gao, and now he saw that even Shopkeeper Sun was smiling like a fox. So he kept his vigilance and said nothing. 

Shopkeeper Sun saw that Xiao Zishan didn’t understand, so could only be a little more blunt. Owner Sun’s meaning was that their Qiwei Escort Agency was willing to watch the house at night, that is, work as night shift security. Apart from store-watching this was actually Qiwei’s main business in the city.

Night watch was not the same as ordinary courtyard guards. The escort agency would not care about whatever happened during the daytime. Only when the guards retired and the rooms and courtyards within the residence were locked and the lamps lit, would the escorts begin patrolling the residence.

“If you feel that it isn’t convenient, you can buy a few servants, and we can train them into good bodyguards instead.”

So it turned out to be a promotion of his security services\! Xiao Zishan thought that it would actually be better to not have night-time security. They had far too many secrets, and the escorts were all capable and astute people. After a while they would inevitably discover some clues. As for training some bodyguards, they would indeed be useful. However, he would need to discuss this matter with the others.

In the end, the Executive Committee members who were in Guangzhou unanimously agreed to make full use of the Qiwei Escort Agency.[^278] Currently, the only real agent they had in Guangzhou was Gao Ju. The network he had was limited to the upper echelons of the city. In contrast, the escort agency was a business that had contacts with all levels of society. From high-level dignitaries all the way down to bandits in the woods, escorts were familiar with them all. It would make their future expansion much easier.

Compared to other jobs and social classes, the workers of the escort agency were the most traditional of martial artists. They valued loyalty and trust above all. If they could cultivate this relationship the escorts would make for reliable allies

To achieve that, they must first win their loyalty. But the people of the escort agency were not like ordinary people. Although they “befriended” bandits, it was really just to put some food on the table. In fact, they were very conservative when making true friends. It wouldn’t be a good idea to win their favour by being overly generous. If they weren’t careful, they would end up being labelled as spoiled rich people with more money than sense.[^279]

Fortunately, China has always been a society built upon familial relationships and clans. The relationship between relatives, clan members, teachers and disciples was the closest. It would be easiest to use this idea as an entry point.

Xiao Zishan followed the script agreed on by the Executive Committee and said to Shopkeeper Sun: “Sun Chang has made a great contribution this time. We have discussed it, and have decided to release him from slavery.”[^280]

“That is a great blessing.” Shopkeeper Sun stood up and bowed deeply. Although being emancipated was not necessarily a good thing for a slave, especially if they had nowhere to go once released and their masters didn’t want to keep them–that would be a road of death–but no matter what, Sun Chang was a junior from the same clan and the nephew of his own master.[^281] Sun Chang being a slave was a shame for his master-uncle,

“He earned this blessing by his own effort.” He deliberately glanced at Gao Xian who was serving tea for them, “The masters were in trouble, but he was not afraid. He was willing to take initiative and work hard in a time of crises. Naturally, we cannot treat him unfairly.”

He continued: “Although Sun Chang is now released, he is still loyal and reliable. If he is willing, he can stay here to continue working for us.”

“You truly view that kid Sun Chang highly\!” Shopkeeper Sun was excited. Even if the escort agency had good business, he still had to travel all over the country for the rest of his life. If Sun Chang could continue working under the Australian merchants, his future prospects would be much brighter than if he stayed as an escort.

“In the future when Sun Chang goes out to perform tasks, please take care of him.”

“Naturally,” Shopkeeper Sun patted his chest, “What you tell me to do is what Qiwei will do. I will do my best.”

Xiao Zishan motioned Gao Xian to leave the room, only after which did he continue, “And there is also Gao Di. You have seen him before, he is a servant here. I asked him to collect news about the markets in Guangzhou. He is very clever and quick on his feet. But I am worried that he is still too young and might go astray if he roams around the marketplace too much. Also, he has never trained his body and might easily suffer in confrontations. Can Qiwei please train him? Although escorts have many connections in both the black and white sides of society, it is truly rare for them to be so upstanding and not crooked like you. If we can place Gao Di into your hands it would bring us much relief.”

“Thank you for the compliment.” Shopkeeper Sun was in high spirits; the Australian bosses really valued them highly.

Xiao Zishan saw that their relationship had warmed to about the right level, so he decided to stop talking and let everything grow naturally from now on. Both sides exchanged a few more casual remarks and then parted.

\*\*\*

Xiao Zishan returned that night and reported the situation. The issue of letting Gao Ju buy on credit caused a fierce debate. Both the affirmers and opposers had very good reasons. Neither side could convince the other.

What Yu Eshui said however presented a possible resolution.

“What month is it over there now?”

“30th of the 4th month.”

“So, the 30th of the 4th month of the 7th year of Tianqi.” Yu Eshui nodded, “In another eighteen days, Emperor Xizong, that is Tianqi,[^282] will be going to the Western Garden for leisure after offering sacrifices at Fangze Temple.[^283] Unfortunately, the wind would capsize the boat and he would fall into the water. Although he was rescued by Tan Jing, his health was on an unrecoverable decline after that.”[^284]

“But the Emperor would not die until the 8th month. Do you want Gao Ju to delay the construction of the shrine until August? I’m afraid that even if you pretend to be supernatural beings he wouldn’t have the guts to wait until then.” The quick-witted people had already understood Yu Eshui’s train of thought.

“Haha, you underestimate the bureaucrats’ perceptivity of political trends.” Yu Eshui said, “How did Wei Zhongxian become the Nine Thousand Years Old? Wasn’t it because he had the blessing of the Emperor himself? His rise and fall hinges on the life and death of Emperor Xizong. Tianqi had always had a somewhat frail body, and he would never recover from falling into the water this time. Once the emperor dies his heir will definitely seize the throne. Even if Wei Zhongxian doesn’t fall, he would definitely not be able to throw his weight around like heis during the Tianqi period now. In such an unclear political situation, the bureaucrats would definitely not eagerly commit their support for any one party.

“Since this Eunuch Yang was never on Wei Zhongxian’s side, but only wanted to take this chance to curry favour, if the situation suddenly becomes so muddied, I’m afraid that he’ll be one of the first to delay. If he doesn’t take the initiative to build the shrine, then that means he supports the current status quo; if he does build it, and the emperor dies and a new emperor rises, isn’t that just making things difficult for himself?”

“But you’re forgetting something. Will Wei Zhongxian just watch idly as the heir takes the throne? We know that after Tianqi was Chongzhen, but these bureaucrats don’t.”

“But Tianqi had no children of his own, so of course the throne could only go to his brothers.” Someone explained. 

“In fact, Tianqi had three sons in total, but they never reached the age of majority. According to modern historiography, these princes were likely killed by two assassins: surnamed Wei and Ke. By the seventh year of his reign, the youngest son had been dead for two years already. Once the emperor fell mortally ill, the only person who he could pass the throne to was his brother Youjian.”[^285]

"Although Tianqi was quite muddle-headed, he deeply treasured his empress, surnamed Zhang, and his fifth brother Youjian. Wei Zhongxian once attempted to create a big ruckus and framed the empress's father Zhang Guoji for ‘plotting to take the throne’, all as a cover to crack down on his enemies. Wang Tiqian, the eunuch of the Imperial Household Department, knew the Emperor's temper and urged him: ‘His Majesty is not good at handling affairs of state, but does have a good relationship with his brother and wife. If anything were to happen to them, we will die\!’ Wei Zhongxian was shocked and quickly back-pedalled his plan. Everyone can see from this Emperor Xizong's trust in the empress and his brothers. Unless Tianqi has another child, it is a foregone conclusion his brother will ascend to the throne after he dies. The bureaucrats are very clear on this matter as well."

"Once the emperor falls sick, Wei Zhongxian, who was once a blue chip on the Ming stock market, will be in great peril, while Tianqi’s brother Youjian, the newly listed stock with great potential, will naturally be favoured. At this time, who will go and buy a large amount of stock that may soon drop below the initial issue price, or even be suspended outright?"

"Then should I notify Gao Ju to delay everything until the 18th of the 5th month?"

"The news should not spread that fast, right? It would take at least ten days for the news from Beijing to reach Guangzhou. It would be better to notify him to delay until the end of the fifth month and re-evaluate according to the situation then."

"Haha, although I don't agree with playing these tricks usually, I think on this matter we can reveal a little bit of a prophecy: clearly state that the government will drastically change on the 18th of the fifth month. To be able to predict the future is an extremely attractive ability, let alone predicting such a major event like a change in government. Once our prediction is verified, our influence would become extremely potent–dare I say godlike. Although it will not make others worship at our feet, it can also fully increase the perception that we are acting in accordance with the Mandate of Heaven." Yu Eshui said with a smile.

This solution was not only unique, but also satisfied the craving of the time travellers to act as "prophets". For a while there were some people suggesting that Yu Eshui act as a "prophet" to talk to Gao Ju and Eunuch Yang Jr., and others even suggested that Yu Eshui directly go to Beijing to find Eunuch Cao Huachun.[^286] Maybe in the future, they could get the direct support of Chongzhen, and the time travellers could use modern technology and concepts to influence the emperor and bring all of China into a democratic, harmonious, and prosperous Ming Dynasty...

Yu Eshui immediately lost his appetite: Do these people think that the Eastern Depot and the   

Embroidered Uniform Guard are filled deaf and blind people? Such "evil words" that talk about the life and death of the emperor, it would be strange if they weren’t thrown into the imperial prison and taste the torture of becoming eunuchs. Even if Eunuch Cao Huachun was willing to listen to the crazy talk of the travellers, Chongzhen was still hiding his strength and biding his time. He would rarely even see his own attendants, so why would he meet with any "prophet"\! If the committee really passed this resolution, then whoever wanted to be a prophet could volunteer, but he would certainly not be joining in this ‘fun’.

Fortunately, there were not many people who were that impulsive, and this whimsical resolution was not adopted. Yu Eshui then put forward some more ideas to hone in the details. For example, they shouldn’t be explicit, so as to avoid scaring Gao Ju. Fear would create many uncontrollable factors. They should just state that there will be a big change on the 18th of the 5th month. It was also important to not say that they knew it themselves, and to just maintain that someone observed the stars at night and deduced it. That would be vague enough.

"Keep one thing in mind. Above all else, never, ever say that Wei Zhongxian will fall out of favour or that the Emperor will die. If there is such a serious matter, Gao Ju will definitely tell Eunuch Yang Jr. With the nature of these people, be it because they want to avoid disaster or for merit, they will immediately report and arrest you\!" Yu Eshui emphasised to everyone.  


[^278]:  In the original it just says ‘Executive Committee’, not how many people. I have clarified that only parts of the Committee should be present in Guangzhou.

[^279]:  Original says 秧子, taking a guess at what that means here.

[^280]:  ‘Released’ in original is, literally, ‘deregistered’ 

[^281]:  TODO: double check this family relationship

[^282]:  Tianqi is the reign name of Emperor Xizong

[^283]:  The main structure of the Temple of Earth complex in Beijing.

[^284]:  If Baidu is to be trusted, the emperor actually fell into water in the 5th month of the 5th year of Tianqi (1625), 2 years before the time that Boaster is using here. See the Chinese [entry](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9C%B1%E7%94%B1%E6%A0%A1/8760087). This change is probably for plot convenience.

[^285]:  Original refers to Chongzhen as Prince of Xin, *xin wang* (信王), which is a noble title given to Chongzhen. Youjian was Chongzhen’s birth name.

[^286]:  Cao Huachun was the chief eunuch of Chongzhen, the last Ming Emperor. He was put in charge by the Emperor in a final attempt to save the capital against the invaders from the north.
