At a pier in Nanxiong there were many large and small boats moored. This was Guangdong’s main north-south transit port. All the merchants who were travelling south to Guangdong would cross the Dayu Mountains through Nanan county in Jiangxi, before boarding a boat at Nanxiong. From there they would have easy passage down to Guangzhou. 

The delegation led by Eunuch Yang Jr–that is, Yang Tianliang–had taken two louchuan[^208] down from Beijing. One was for him and his servants, while the other was for his assistants, stewards, entertainers, guards, and so on. The two boats did not show flags, signs, lanterns or other identifiers. This was because Eunuch Yang was not a particularly popular person in the palace, and it was becoming hard to even preserve his place. If they were to hang up signs it would bring nothing except undue attention. Along the way, even if some local officials were willing to entertain the party, Eunuch Yang Jr. was afraid of accepting their invitations. Therefore, he took an undecorated sedan chair or a boat, and along the way didn’t stop at any stage stations[^209] nor pay any visits. He just kept his head down and hurried on his way. Now that he had rested on the boat for a day, his weariness from the long journey had already half-disappeared. His retinue was playing Mahjong on the boat to pass the time. They had also invited Yang Tianling, but he had declined.

It wasn’t that he hated playing Mahjong.[^210] It was just that something felt a little off on this trip to the south. 

Yang Tianliang was accepted into the palace in the latter part of Emperor Wanli’s reign. He was assigned to work under Eunuch Yang, where he demonstrated his abilities and became an adopted son. In turn, Eunuch Yang was one of Gao Shiming’s confidants.[^211] Originally, Yang Tianling had a bright road ahead of him in the palace with these two big trees to rely on. 

Unexpectedly, when the new Emperor took power, Eunuch Gao Shiming resigned. Consequently, Yang Tianling’s adopted father was either sent to dig graves in the mausoleum or was just idling in the palace. Even he himself had not done any proper work for three or four years. Fortunately, he still had some past connections, and so ended up getting a job as a supervisor in the imperial printing shop.[^212] 

Usually the father and son rarely met, and usually each just kept their own business. Even when they met they wouldn’t discuss anything about the affairs of the imperial palace in order to avoid suspicion as much as possible.

However, in the last few years, the power of the Emperor had become overwhelming, and the lives of the pair had become increasingly difficult. Around them, courtiers who had fallen out of favour either capitulated in fear or resigned. Ever since the intercalary sixth month of last year, starting with the governor of Zhejiang Pan Ruzhen, officials from all over the country had been petitioning to erect shrines for Wei Zhongxian.[^213] In the blink of an eye, there were already more than 40 shrines built. This moved the usually indolent Eunuch Yang to also build one.

So far, the shrines had been built by administrators from the palace and civil and military officials of various regions, and the palace eunuchs had not yet participated. If Eunuch Yang was the first to do so? Not to mention that it was a chance to greatly change the Nine Thousand Year’s impression of him, but it also would at least leave an impression of respect.

However, when Eunuch Yang thought it over again, it was not quite appropriate for him to build such a shrine. He was not a close confidant of Eunuch Wei Zhongxian, and so his action would be uncalled for and also offend those close to Wei Zhongxian; after all, his flattering must not steal the limelight from others. After deliberating over things again, he realised that only officials and gentry had built ancestral halls, but there was no movement yet from merchants. This could be a breakthrough for him, as he had Guangzhou’s Gao Ju as a chess piece. Recently Gao Ju had gifted him a lot of exotic goods from overseas, and it seemed like he had made a lot of money. Eunuch Yang thus decided to borrow Gao Ju’s newfound wealth and let him handle this matter.

It was under this context that Yang Tianliang was dispatched to Guangzhou. He had received instructions from his adoptive father that the shrine in Guangzhou was to be grand but also must represent the sincere attitude of the merchants. With the situation as it was, if Gao Ju contacted a group of merchants and petitioned the local officials in Guangdong, they would definitely never be refused. 

As for how much money should be spent on this ‘grand’ shrine, Eunuch Yang had no real say in the matter. But Gao Ju had been under his shelter for so many years, so it was definitely reasonable for him to spend some money—they had always shared in prosperity and adversity.

However, Yang Tianliang did not see things in such a simple light. His thoughts went a little deeper than his adoptive father. All things in the world have their time, and like the tides they rise and fall. Wei Zhongxian was now peaking in his power, and such a small tribute was unnoticeable, like adding a drop of water to a vast ocean. However, if his influence ever waned, this tribute would become an irremovable stain upon their reputation\!

Thinking of this, he shuddered. He looked at the people around him. He suspected that there were thugs from the Eastern Depot hidden among his entourage. Even mentioning this matter would make anyone sweat in anxiety.

Although Yang Tianliang had been hurrying along the journey, he was still thinking about how to manoeuvre in order to make the best of both sides. He felt that his adoptive father was far too short-sighted, always thinking about money. How could the matter be dispensed with just by asking Gao Ju to pay some money? Whether the shrine for the venerable Wei Zhongxianwould be a great achievement or an irremovable stain would all be up to the Creator[^214]—although the Emperor’s spirit lasted for ten thousand years, his mortal embodiment did not seem like it could endure for so long…

What should he do? Yang Tianling kneaded his brows wearily and leaned back in his chair. A lower eunuch came in quietly, and saw that his eyes were closed. The visitor did not dare speak, and just waited quietly. Yang Tianling knew that someone had entered, and snorted:

“What’s the matter?”

“My lord, Master Gao’s steward has spent a long time waiting at the dock for you.”

“Invite him onboard.”

The steward soon arrived and kowtowed. Yang Tianliang recognised that this was Gao Ye, a steward from the Gao family who often came to Beijing to offer gifts. Gao Ye was young, and spoke and acted properly; he was a person who knew how to socialise. 

In addition to welcoming Yang Tianliang he had also brought along a boatful of wine, food and utensils, all of which were exquisitely made.  He had also brought a few male and female actors as entertainment for the rest of the journey.[^215]

The most peculiar thing was actually a fine-grained wooden box, which Gao Ye showed last. Gao Ye said that it was a small gift from Master Gao, who especially bought it from the Australian merchants at a high price.

Yang Tianliang had long been hearing of these Australian merchants. At the start of spring Gao Ju had written a letter: Some Australian merchants had just arrived in Guangzhou bearing some new and exotic goods. They had also brought in some other things: crystal mirrors, fire-lighters that produced a flame with just a quick flick…

Opening the mother-of-pearl lacquered box, he saw two small golden boxes laying inside. They shone brightly, but were made from neither gold nor jade. There were also three strange patterns between the boxes, but he couldn’t tell what it was. Also sandwiched between them was another small candlestick-like thing, which seemed to be gilded with black silver. However, the carving was done poorly and the pattern was also simple.

He looked inquiringly at Gao Ye, and saw Gao Ye delicately take out a paper box and carefully open the lid. Inside was a shiny silver sheet. Peeling it back, a row of neatly arranged white sticks were revealed. A fragrance emanated from them.

“Is it tobacco?” Yang Tianliang’s guilty pleasure was smoking, and he immediately recognised the smell of tobacco.

“These are cigarettes from Australia. My master specifically gifted it to you.” He respectfully pulled out a cigarette and offered it.

Yang Tianliang held up the cigarette. Its body was mostly snow-white. One end was exposed, within which was a pale golden tobacco. The end end was a pale white, but the texture felt tightly packed like silk cotton. At the moment, he wasn’t sure about how to start. He used a pipe to smoke, and had even smelt the snuff brought by westerners, but he had never seen tobacco packaged like this. 

Under Gao Ye’s demonstration, he brought the cigarette to his mouth and lit it with that candle-stick-like lighter. He took a puff, but only felt that the tobacco quality was very average. Not mentioning the very dilute smoke, it was also mixed with some weird fragrance. It was just that with every puff the cigarette flickered on and off, but never went out, which was very strange.

“It’s just some tobacco rolled in paper, yet it’s dressed in such a fancy way. It’s the same as that Australian lighter your master bought.” Although Yang Tianliang said this, he still very much liked these cigarettes. He held the box very tightly: it would make for a good gift for the dignitaries of the Dynasty.

“Steward Gao, do the Australian merchants still have more of these cigarettes?”

“Yes, yes. The merchants brought a lot of them.”

“Good, then prepare a dozen or so boxes for us when we get to Guangzhou. Also include that lighter.”

“I understand.”

Seeing that Young Eunuch Yang stopped talking and closed his eyes again, Gao Ye quietly left.

When Young Eunuch Yang's boat arrived, the time travellers sold another batch of goods, including the new cigarettes. Wen Desi took the opportunity to buy Gao Chang from Master Gao as well. Although everyone had concocted various plans to try and do it covertly, after thinking about it, they realised that instead of trying to perform sneaky tricks it was better to do it over the table. Master Gao was a little surprised, but he thought that this was Gao Qing's request \- to find a way out for the useless sworn brother \- and Gao Chang was not that close to him, so he happily agreed and did not even ask for any silver.

Gao Chang arrived alone carrying only a bindle. After meeting his new masters, he immediately said that he would now change his surname to Wen. The time travellers had never thought about this issue, and now that Gao Chang had brought it up, they realised that changing the surname was very important. It was a way for a servant to feel a sense of belonging to the master. However, changing to Wen was not very suitable as, after all, the time travelling enterprise belonged to everyone and not just Wen Desi. While discussing what they should do, Xiao Zishan proposed that instead of changing to one of their surnames, it would be better to simply restore his original surname. That way they could win over their hearts as, after all, Chinese people had always attached great importance to their ancestral heritage. Losing one's surname was a great shame, while re-embracing one's ancestry was a great honour.

When they asked about his thoughts on the matter, the young man actually knelt down and kowtowed several times, with tears streaming down his face.

"Thanks to the grace of the masters, I have been given my original surname. From now on, I, Sun Chang, belong to you. Through fire and flood I will do whatever the masters command\!"

"What if we return to Australia and never come back to China?"

"Wherever the masters go, Sun Chang will follow, no matter where\!" Sun Chang said firmly.

They had thought it was difficult to recruit a follower,[^216] but it turned out to be so easy? It was as if a bit of their main-character aura was leaking out\![^217]

Wei Zhongxian is sometimes referred to in the text as Nine Thousand Years, a title meant to highlight his position and power, as the Emperor himself was only called Ten Thousand Years. This is terrible to read in translation, so I haven’t done this.
